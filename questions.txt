# ðŸŸ¢ Level 1 â€“ Basics (Concepts & Syntax)
#         1.Write a program to check whether a number is positive, negative, or zero.
#         2.Ask the user for two numbers and print the larger one.
#         3.Take a number as input and check if itâ€™s divisible by both 3 and 5.
#         4.Create a program to print the first 10 natural numbers using a loop.
#         5.Write a program to find the factorial of a number entered by the user.
# ðŸŸ¡ Level 2 â€“ Arrays & Loops
#         1. Create an array of numbers and print only the even numbers from it.
#         2. Find the maximum and minimum number in an array without using built-in functions.
#         3. Write a program that reverses the elements of an array.
#         4. Count how many times a particular number appears in an array.
#         5. Write a program that adds all numbers in an array and prints the average.
# ðŸŸ  Level 3 â€“ Strings & Conditions
#         1. Write a program to count the number of vowels and consonants in a string.
#         2. Check if a given string is a palindrome (same forward and backward).
#         3. Replace all spaces in a string with - (hyphens).
#         4. Take a string and print it with the first letter of each word capitalized.
#         5. Check if a given string contains the word "JavaScript".
# ðŸ”µ Level 4 â€“ Functions & Logic
#         1. Create a function findLargest(a, b, c) that returns the largest of three numbers.
#         2. Write a function that accepts a number and returns true if itâ€™s a prime number, otherwise false.
#         3. Make a function that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array containing only unique elements.
#         4. Write a function that returns the sum of all digits in a given number.
#         5. Create a function reverseWords(str) that reverses the order of words in a sentence.
